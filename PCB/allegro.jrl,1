\i (00:00:47) artwork 
\w (00:00:47) Artwork will be rounded down because the database is in MILS with precision 4 requiring artwork precision of 8 decimal places, which is greater than the maximum of 6. Rounding down might result in inaccurate arc coordinates in the output files and possible shape/void plotting failures. For raster artwork formats, artwork accuracy must be at least one place greater than the database accuracy, up to the maximum accuracy allowed by the selected output format. Use GDSII or IPC2581 manufacturing format that support the level of database accuracy set.
